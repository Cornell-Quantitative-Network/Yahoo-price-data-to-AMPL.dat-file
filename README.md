# Yahoo-price-data-to-AMPL.dat-file
The goal of this project is to create an automatic system that will pull the price data for a list of user-defined securities and output them into a .txt file. This file should be structured in the correct format such that it can be copied and pasted into a .dat AMPL file. The initial purpose is to create a portfolio optimizer for investment clubs.
